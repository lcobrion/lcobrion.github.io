## Dear Friends,

What a week!

I feel like I have spent a lot of time with *Birthright Citizens* this week. So much is packed into these 127 pages!

The major thing that has stuck out to me is how difficult this kind of research is. This book hasn't been written before because these stories (and these laws) are complicated and hard to find. I met Martha Jones last year and I can tell you that she is definitely a lawyer! She is also a skilled writer, and I'm glad we chose this book, even if it is dense and detailed. 

I hope that you are getting a lot out of this work. I have definitely been skimming! But the major points still jump out. I look forward to seeing you on Zoom this Sunday at noon EST to chat! Don't worry if you haven't finished the book. You can even choose a single chapter to read. Mostly, I'm excited to see you.


## Be well,
## Carrington

## Week One of Birthright Citizens Reading Schedule

**Monday, July 20.** Preface, Acknowledgments & Introduction.

Here are the thoughts I jotted down on my first day of reading: 
1. Jones doesn't mind using the first person.
2. The phrase "shardlike courthouse records."
3. Legal history is tough but Jones is clearly a great writer when even the Acknowledgments are eloquent.
4. What is a right? What is citizenship?
5. Law does not always equal the reality on the ground.

**Tuesday, July 21.** Chapter One: Being a Native, and Free Born: Race and Rights in Baltimore.

</p>

Though sometimes the characters are hard to follow, their stories are compelling. 

The parallels with immigrants today start in the first chapter, where free Blacks exist in legal "limbo," and don't stop throughout the entire book.

**Wednesday, July 22.** Chapter Two: Threats of Removal: Colonization, Emigration, and the Borders of Belonging.

</p>

This is my favorite chapter. The distinctions between emigration and colonization are so fascinating and poignant. The descriptions of coordinated Black activism are all new to me and the result of really important research.

**Thursday, July 23.** Chapters Three & Four: Aboard the Constitution: Black Sailors and Citizenship at Sea and The City Courthouse: Everyday Scenes of Race and Law.

This chapter highlighted for me how lacking our legal history education so often is. You often hear things like "free Blacks lived difficult lives." In this chapter, Jones lays out exactly what those difficulties were. They often took the form of laws we would describe as fascist or authoritarian today. I think it is essential that we learn and talk about them now, and that we acknowledge them as foundational to the United States.

**Friday, July 24.** Chapter Five: Between the Constitution and the Discipline of the Church: Making Congregants Citizens.

</p>

This was the most difficult chapter for me. The structures of Black churches and various courts were hard to navigate. That being said, I ended this chapter with a lively portrait of these community centers and I left convinced that Black Baltimore residents were often participants in the law through religion.

**Saturday, July 25.** Chapter Six: By Virtue of Unjust Laws: Blacks Laws as the Performance of Rights.

</p>

What do you make of the framing of unjust laws the performance of rights? Can a racist law be a positive step toward citizenship? Jones' argument is fresh and innovative - and I think I buy it.

**Sunday, July 26.** Chapter Seven: To Sue and Be Sued: Courthouse Claims and the Contours of Citizenship.

This chapter was heartbreaking, especially the section on Orphan Court. It is also a wonderful use of sources. This book, unlike our last choice, primarily uses primary sources.

What did you think so far? How is your reading coming!
