title: History Together - Week One
excerpt: “We are living in the age of Hamilton,” admitted Annette Gordon-Reed at a recent book talk. Reed’s comment is surprising - she’s a leading scholar on Thomas Jefferson, Hamilton’s rival. But her praise is not; nowadays, everyone loves Hamilton.

## Dear Friends,

Below you will find the reading schedule for Week 1 of History Together, an online read-along focusing on works that illuminate American history through the lens of race. We will begin with [*Never Caught: The Washingtons' Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge*](ericaarmstrongdunbar.com/nevercaught-ericaarmstrongdunbar) by Erica Armstrong Dunbar. 

Each day, I will share a few thoughts from that day's chapter. You can find my observations, as well as the ideas you all have shared using #HistoryTogether, collected here. I hope our daily reading is a time to reflect, individually and as a group, and to develop a community in the process.

I also hope you will join me on the evening of Wednesday, July 8 for a virtual get together to meet and talk to each other about the book.

Thank you so much for starting this journey with me!

## Be well,
## Carrington
