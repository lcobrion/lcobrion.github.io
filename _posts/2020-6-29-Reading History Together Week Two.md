## Dear Friends,

It has been a great joy reading along with you this last week. Thank you so much for your enthusiasm, perspectives and eloquent thoughts.

I have found 15 pages a day a delightful meditation, a way to stick with Ona's story over time. I have rarely read a history book in this way, savoring it. Others have preferred to read in big chunks or all at once, compelled by Ona' story. Whether you are reading quickly or slowly, I am glad you are here.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the intersections of race and gender have come to the forefront in your comments. Jessica shared that Dunbar "paints [Martha] as incredibly fragile and committed to slavery." Katherine noticed a similarly negative portrait of Martha's granddaughter Eliza. These woman would have had enormous power over Ona. Some historians even argue that white woman had more control over enslaved people than their husbands. It is a dynamic that bears fruit today. However, it remains one-sided, as we have only the white women's words in our archives.

The dearth of evidence about enslaved women is something we all know, in the back of our minds, to be true. However, reading about Ona this week, I have felt it deeply. It seems to me a brave act to write a book around Ona, despite the hollow record we are left with.

In the coming days, please continue to comment on the blog and share your thoughts on social media (publicly or privately!) I would love to see pictures of where you're reading.

We continue to be alone, together.


## Be well,
## Carrington

The structure of this book is impeccable, with Ona's liberation dead center. 

I have heard from many of you that your hopes for the second half include more of Ona's voice. It is certainly a question mark throughout this pivotal chapter.

**Tuesday, June 30.** Chapter Nine: Slavery and Freedom in New Hampshire.

Ona is such a wonderful example of why some enslaved people sought freedom, and why many did not. The context Dunbar provides about life in New Hampshire and Virginia is key. 

This chapter has triggered thoughts for many of you about the North's complicity in slavery, and the complex reasons that America's two regions differed so much on this issue, even so early on in the country's existence.

**Wednesday, July 1.** Chapter Ten: A Close Call.

With almost no details, Dunbar imagines a pivotal encounter in Ona's life. It features another white woman who endangers Ona's fragile freedom.

**Thursday, July 2.** Chapter Eleven: The Negotiator.

This chapter has been the most fascinating for me. The fact that Ona is able to negotiate with Whipple brilliantly illustrates just what freedom means. It is the ability to make one's own choices - period.

**Friday, July 3.** Chapter Twelve: Mrs. Staines.

**Saturday, July 4.** Chapter Thirteen: The Survivor.

**Sunday, July 5.** Epilogue: Ona's Sister: Philadelphia Costin.

**Wednesday, July 8.** Zoom Finale.
