## Dear Friends,

Below you will find the reading schedule for Week 1 of History Together, an online read-along focusing on works that illuminate American history through the lens of race. We will begin with [*Never Caught: The Washingtons' Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge*](http://ericaarmstrongdunbar.com/nevercaught-ericaarmstrongdunbar) by Erica Armstrong Dunbar. 

Each day, I will share a few thoughts from that day's chapter. You can find my observations, as well as the ideas you all have shared using #HistoryTogether, collected here. I hope our daily reading is a time to reflect, individually and as a group, and to develop a community in the process.

I also hope you will join me on the evening of Wednesday, July 8 for a virtual get together to meet and talk to each other about the book.

Thank you so much for starting this journey with me!

## Be well,
## Carrington

## Week One Reading Schedule

**Monday, June 21.** Author's Note, Foreward & Chapter One: Betty's Daughter.

In this opening, I am struck by Dunbar's footnote on the use of enslavement vs. slave, a topic that has been much discussed in the last few weeks. Reading this chapter, it is easy to forget how little historical evidence she has to go on.

"Her distinctive name set her apart from her siblings and from the majority of the other bondmen and bondwomen who toiled with her in Virginia." For more on the power of names for black women, see Martha Jones in [this week's New York Times.](http://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/style/self-care/sojourner-truth-harriet-tubman-slavery-names.html)
