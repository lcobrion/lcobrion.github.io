## Dear Friends,

It has been a great joy reading along with you this last week. Thank you so much for your enthusiasm, perspectives and eloquent thoughts.

I have found 15 pages a day a delightful meditation, a way to stick with Ona's story over time. I have rarely read a history book in this way, savoring it. Others have preferred to read in big chunks or all at once, compelled by Ona' story. Whether you are reading quickly or slowly, I am glad you are here.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the intersections of race and gender have come to the forefront in your comments. Jessica shared that Dunbar "paints [Martha] as incredibly fragile and committed to slavery." Katherine noticed a similarly negative portrait of Martha's granddaughter Eliza. These woman would have had enormous power over Ona. Some historians even argue that white woman had more control over enslaved people than their husbands. It is a dynamic that bears fruit today. However, it remains one-sided, as we have only the white women's words in our archives.

The dearth of evidence about enslaved women is something we all know, in the back of our minds, to be true. However, reading about Ona this week, I have felt it deeply. It seems to me a brave act to write a book around Ona, despite the hollow record we are left with.

In the coming days, please continue to comment on the blog and share your thoughts on social media (publicly or privately!) I would love to see pictures of where you're reading.

We continue to be alone, together.


## Be well,
## Carrington

## Week Two Reading Schedule

**Monday, June 29.** Chapter Eight: The Fugitive.

</p>

The structure of this book is impeccable, with Ona's liberation dead center. 

I have heard from many of you that your hopes for the second half include more of Ona's voice. It is certainly a question mark throughout this pivotal chapter.

**Tuesday, June 30.** Chapter Nine: Slavery and Freedom in New Hampshire.

Ona is such a wonderful example of why some enslaved people sought freedom, and why many did not. The context Dunbar provides about life in New Hampshire and Virginia is key. 

This chapter has triggered thoughts for many of you about the North's complicity in slavery, and the complex reasons that America's two regions differed so much on this issue, even so early on in the country's existence.

**Wednesday, July 1.** Chapter Ten: A Close Call.

</p>

With almost no details, Dunbar imagines a pivotal encounter in Ona's life. It features another white woman who endangers Ona's fragile freedom.

**Thursday, July 2.** Chapter Eleven: The Negotiator.

</p>

This chapter has been the most fascinating for me. The fact that Ona is able to negotiate with Whipple brilliantly illustrates just what freedom means. It is the ability to make one's own choices - period.

**Friday, July 3.** Chapter Twelve: Mrs. Staines.

I am thinking a lot about Ona's freedom today. Confronted several times with evidence of her legal status, she asserted her liberty.

Dunbar does a wonderful job highlighting the potential that freedom held for even the poorest of African Americans. Ona's story is also an interesting case study on the way that public opinion, rather than the law alone, can protect the vulnerable.

**Saturday, July 4.** Chapter Thirteen: The Survivor.

I hope that Ona's story made you see the Fourth of July a little differently this year. I would love to know what Ona thought about the holiday, and whether she celebrated, or perhaps preferred to commemorate alternative Black liberation holidays like Emancipation Day.

For more on how Black Americans celebrated the Fourth in the 19th century, see [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/02/fourth-july-is-black-american-holiday/), [here](http://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/07/fourth-of-july-black-holiday/564320/) and [here.](http://repository.wellesley.edu/object/ir1009) Or simply take a look at my Instagram story highlight!

**Sunday, July 5.** Epilogue: Ona's Sister: Philadelphia Costin.

We've come to the end! I hope that you've enjoyed this book as much as I have. This epilogue and acknowledgements provide tempting glimpses into the rich fabric of African American history beyond Ona and her family. What do you hope to read next?

**Wednesday, July 8.** Zoom Finale.

I hope that you will join me on Wednesday for a very casual conversation about this book, Ona's story and our collective reading experience. All I ask is that you bring a quote from the book that surprised you. Zoom link [here](http://us02web.zoom.us/j/87615828672?pwd=MVBQdWt3Y0pXK0RLUEdUNFppa200QT09), password is Ona.
