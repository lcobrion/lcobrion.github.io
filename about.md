**About me**<br>  
I'm passionate about helping people get the most out of the world around them through transformative educational experiences. I have experience creating and marketing educational content and data for all ages, as well as recruiting students and developing exciting programming. I recently obtained my MPhil in United States History at the University of Cambridge. I also graduated from Wellesley College in 2015 with a BA in American Studies and History.
